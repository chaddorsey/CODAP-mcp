# 3-1 Design Browser Worker Architecture

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Define the technical architecture and interfaces for the browser worker component that will handle SSE connections, polling fallback, tool execution, and response handling. This foundational task establishes the design patterns and structure for all subsequent implementation tasks.

## Requirements

1. **Component Architecture**: Define the main browser worker components and their relationships
2. **Interface Design**: Specify TypeScript interfaces for tool requests, responses, and configuration
3. **State Management**: Design state management approach for connection status and execution tracking
4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Define error types and recovery patterns
5. **Integration Points**: Identify integration points with existing CODAP plugin API and pairing UI
6. **Configuration**: Define configuration options and environment variables needed

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture Review
- Review existing codebase structure and patterns
- Identify existing MCP tool registry and execution framework
- Analyze current relay API endpoints and data formats

### Phase 2: Component Design
- Design ConnectionManager class for SSE/polling logic
- Design ToolExecutor class for MCP tool execution
- Design ResponseHandler class for posting results
- Define shared interfaces and types

### Phase 3: State Management Design
- Define connection states (disconnected, connecting, connected, error)
- Design execution tracking for concurrent requests
- Plan error state management and recovery

### Phase 4: Integration Design
- Map integration points with CODAP plugin API
- Plan integration with existing pairing banner component
- Design configuration approach

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that the architectural design is sound and implementable.

**Test Scope**: Architecture documentation and interface definitions.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors for interface definitions
- Architecture design review identifies all required components
- Integration points with existing codebase are clearly defined

**Success Criteria**: 
- Complete architectural documentation created
- TypeScript interfaces compile successfully
- All integration points identified and documented

## Verification

- [x] Architecture document created with component diagrams
- [x] TypeScript interfaces defined for all data structures
- [x] Integration points with existing codebase documented
- [x] Error handling strategy documented
- [x] Configuration requirements identified

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/services/browserWorker/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
- `src/services/browserWorker/README.md` - Architecture documentation

### Modified Files
- None (architecture phase only)
