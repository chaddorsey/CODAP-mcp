# 3-2 Implement Connection Manager

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the Connection Manager component that handles SSE connections with EventSource API and heartbeat monitoring. This component provides the foundation for receiving tool requests from the relay server with automatic fallback capabilities.

## Requirements

1. **SSE Connection Management**: Implement EventSource connection to relay server
2. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Monitor heartbeat events and detect connection failures
3. **Connection State Tracking**: Maintain and expose connection status
4. **Event Handling**: Process SSE events (connected, tool-request, heartbeat, error, timeout)
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle connection failures with exponential backoff
6. **Event-Driven Interface**: Provide addEventListener/removeEventListener API
7. **Configuration Support**: Accept connection configuration parameters

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Connection Manager Class
- Create `ConnectionManager` class implementing `ConnectionManagerInterface`
- Set up basic EventSource connection handling
- Implement connection state management

### Phase 2: SSE Event Processing
- Handle SSE event types: connected, tool-request, heartbeat, error, timeout
- Parse event data and validate structure
- Emit events to registered listeners

### Phase 3: Heartbeat Monitoring
- Track heartbeat events from relay server
- Detect missed heartbeats and connection failures
- Implement connection health detection logic

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Recovery
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Handle various error scenarios (network, timeout, server errors)
- Provide graceful error recovery

### Phase 5: Event Listener Management
- Implement addEventListener/removeEventListener functionality
- Support multiple event types: "message", "error", "status-change"
- Ensure proper cleanup on disconnect

## Test Plan

**Objective**: Verify that the Connection Manager establishes SSE connections, monitors heartbeats, and handles errors appropriately.

**Test Scope**: Connection Manager class, SSE event handling, heartbeat monitoring, error recovery.

**Environment & Setup**: 
- Mock EventSource for unit tests
- Test relay server for integration tests
- Test session codes and valid endpoints

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock EventSource API for unit tests
- Mock relay server responses for error scenarios
- Real relay server for integration testing

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Successful Connection**: EventSource connects to relay SSE endpoint successfully
2. **Event Processing**: Correctly parses and handles different SSE event types
3. **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Detects heartbeat events and identifies connection health
4. **Connection Failure**: Handles EventSource errors and initiates retry logic
5. **Exponential Backoff**: Retry delays increase correctly with each failure
6. **Event Listeners**: addEventListener/removeEventListener work correctly
7. **Status Changes**: Connection status updates are accurate and timely
8. **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup when disconnect() is called

**Success Criteria**: 
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests successfully connect to relay server
- Error recovery scenarios work correctly
- Heartbeat monitoring detects connection issues
- Event listener management functions properly

## Verification

- [x] ConnectionManager class created implementing ConnectionManagerInterface
- [x] SSE connection established to relay server endpoint
- [x] Heartbeat monitoring detects connection health
- [x] Event processing handles all SSE event types correctly
- [x] Error handling with exponential backoff implemented
- [x] Event listener management (add/remove) functional
- [x] Connection status tracking accurate
- [x] Unit tests with comprehensive coverage (minor timer mock issues to be resolved)
- [ ] Integration tests pass with real relay server
