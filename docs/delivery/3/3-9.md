# 3-9 Add Connection Status Indicators

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive visual indicators for connection status and tool execution to provide users with clear, real-time feedback about the browser worker's operational state. This task focuses on creating additional status components, enhancing existing indicators, and providing detailed execution feedback that complements the existing connection status display.

   - ðŸ”µ Blue: Tool currently executing
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Tool completed successfully
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Tool execution failed
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Tool queued or pending

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Status**: Large, prominent connection state indicator
2. **Secondary Status**: Tool execution and performance metrics
3. **Tertiary Status**: Historical data and detailed metrics
