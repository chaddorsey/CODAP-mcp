# 19-4 Automate Build and Packaging Process

[Back to task list](../19/tasks.md)

## Description
Create scripts and configuration to automate building, testing, and packaging the Claude Desktop extension as a .dxt file for one-click installation. Ensure the process is developer-friendly and produces a valid, up-to-date extension package.

## Requirements
- Add a build script (e.g., npm script or shell script) to package the extension as a .dxt file
- Use the official DXT toolchain (`@anthropic-ai/dxt`)
- Ensure the build process copies/updates all required files (manifest, server, etc.)
- Validate the manifest and package before output
- Output a `.dxt` file ready for local install and testing
- Document the build process in the extension README

## Implementation Plan
1. Add `@anthropic-ai/dxt` as a dev dependency (or document global install)
2. Add a build/package script to `package.json` (e.g., `npm run build:dxt`)
3. Ensure all files are included and up to date before packaging
4. Run `dxt pack` to generate the `.dxt` file
5. Validate the output and update documentation

## Verification
- Running the build script produces a valid `.dxt` file
- The extension can be installed in Claude Desktop via drag-and-drop
- Manifest passes DXT validation
- Build process is documented in README
