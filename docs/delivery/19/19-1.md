## Description
Draft a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Claude Desktop extension, including user and developer requirements, and create an initial manifest.json for the Desktop Extension (.dxt) format.

## Status History

## Requirements
- PRD must clearly describe:
  - User goals: seamless, one-click Claude Desktop extension installation for CODAP control
  - Developer goals: easy local development, testing, and packaging for Claude Desktop
  - Key features, user stories, and acceptance criteria
- Initial `manifest.json` must:
  - Follow Anthropic DXT spec (see [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions))
  - Include extension metadata, server config, and tool declarations
  - Be ready for iterative refinement in later tasks

## Implementation Plan
1. Review Anthropic Desktop Extension documentation and DXT manifest schema
2. Draft PRD sections: Overview, Problem Statement, User Stories, Technical Approach, Acceptance Criteria
3. Create a minimal but valid `manifest.json` for the extension, referencing the MCP server entry point and tools
4. Link manifest fields to PRD requirements
5. Prepare for review and feedback

## Verification
- PRD reviewed and approved by project owner
- `manifest.json` passes DXT tool validation (`dxt pack`)
- All required manifest fields present and correct
- PRD and manifest are ready for use in subsequent tasks

## Files Modified
