# 19-2 Set Up Extension Project Structure

[Back to task list](../19/tasks.md)

## Description
Establish the directory structure for the Claude Desktop extension, including a `server/` folder for MCP server code, the `manifest.json`, and all required dependencies. Prepare the project for local development and DXT packaging.

| 2025-07-03 12:20:00 | Status Change | Proposed | Done | Extension project structure created and committed | AI_Agent |

## Requirements
- Create a new extension project folder (e.g., `claude-extension/` or similar)
- Include:
  - `server/` directory for MCP server entry point and logic
  - `manifest.json` (copied from 19-1)
  - `node_modules/` and `package.json` for dependencies
  - Optional: `icon.png`, `README.md`
- Ensure the structure matches DXT packaging requirements
- Prepare for local development and testing

## Implementation Plan
1. Create the extension project directory in the repo (e.g., `claude-extension/`)
2. Copy or symlink the initial `manifest.json` into the extension folder
3. Create a `server/` subdirectory and placeholder `index.js`
4. Initialize `package.json` and install any required dependencies
5. Add `.gitkeep` or placeholder files as needed for empty folders
6. Document the structure in `README.md` (optional)

## Verification
- Extension folder exists with correct structure
- `manifest.json` present and valid
- `server/index.js` placeholder exists
- Project is ready for further development and DXT packaging
