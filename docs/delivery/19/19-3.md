# 19-3 Implement MCP Server Entry Point

[Back to task list](../19/tasks.md)

## Description
Develop the Node.js MCP server entry point for the Claude Desktop extension, ensuring it forwards all JSON-RPC requests to the remote CODAP MCP server and is compatible with Claude Desktop.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-07-04 13:00:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | AI_Agent |
| 2025-07-04 13:10:00 | Status Change | Proposed | Done | MCP server entry point implemented as relay and committed | AI_Agent |

## Requirements
- Entry point must read JSON-RPC requests from stdin and forward to remote MCP server
- Use https://codap-mcp-stable.vercel.app/api/mcp as the remote endpoint
- Pass session code as query parameter, matching current relay client
- Log all activity and errors to stderr
- Implement a 10s timeout for remote calls
- No local tool logic or browser/plugin communication required

## Implementation Plan
1. Copy/adapt logic from current relay client
2. Implement robust stdio handling and error logging
3. Forward all requests to remote server, handle timeouts
4. Test with sample JSON-RPC requests
5. Commit and document

## Verification
- Entry point relays requests and responses correctly
- Claude Desktop can discover and use all tools via the extension
- Verbose logging appears in stderr
- No local tool logic is present

## Files Modified
- claude-extension/server/index.js (new entry point)
