# 19-5 Add E2E Test for Extension in Claude Desktop

[Back to task list](../19/tasks.md)

## Description
Implement an end-to-end (E2E) test to verify that the packaged Claude Desktop extension can be installed, discovered, and used by Claude Desktop, and that tool calls are successfully relayed to the remote MCP server.

## Requirements
- Test that the `.dxt` file can be installed in Claude Desktop via drag-and-drop or the Extensions UI
- Verify that Claude Desktop discovers the extension and lists all available tools
- Issue a sample tool call (e.g., `tools/list` or `createDataContext`) and confirm the response is relayed from the remote MCP server
- Log and document the test process and results
- Preferably automate the test if possible (e.g., with Playwright or a script), or provide a clear manual test protocol

## Implementation Plan
1. Build the extension `.dxt` file using the automated script
2. Install the extension in Claude Desktop (manual or automated)
3. Use Claude Desktop to discover and invoke tools via the extension
4. Capture logs and responses to verify correct operation
5. Document the test steps and results in the extension README

## Verification
- Extension installs without errors in Claude Desktop
- All tools are discoverable and callable
- Tool calls are relayed and responses received from the remote MCP server
- Test protocol and results are documented

## Files Modified
- docs/delivery/19/19-5.md (this file)
- claude-extension/README.md (test protocol/results)
