# PBI-13: Comprehensive Secrets Management and Security Practices

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-13)

## Overview
Implement enterprise-grade secrets management and security practices including proper secret rotation, secure storage, audit logging, and security scanning to ensure the relay system meets production security standards.

## Problem Statement
Current implementation has basic security with manual secret management, no rotation strategy, and limited security monitoring. For production deployment, we need comprehensive secrets management, automated security scanning, and proper audit trails.

## User Stories
- As a Security Engineer, I want automated secret rotation so credentials remain secure
- As a DevOps Engineer, I want secure secret storage so no credentials are exposed
- As a Compliance Officer, I want audit logs so we can track security events
- As a Platform Engineer, I want security scanning so vulnerabilities are caught early

## Technical Approach
1. **Secret Rotation**: Automated rotation of bypass tokens and API keys
2. **Secure Storage**: Proper use of Vercel environment variables and external secret stores
3. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-related events
4. **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection in CI/CD
5. **Access Control**: Proper access controls and least privilege principles

### Security Components
- **Secret Rotation**: Automated bypass token rotation schedule
- **Vault Integration**: External secret management for sensitive data
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers on all responses
- **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting and DDoS protection
- **Monitoring**: Security event monitoring and alerting

### Implementation Plan
1. Set up secret rotation automation
2. Implement comprehensive audit logging
3. Add security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
4. Enhance security headers and CORS policies
5. Set up security monitoring and alerting
6. Document security procedures and incident response

## UX/UI Considerations
No direct UI impact. Enhanced security should be transparent to users while providing better protection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated rotation strategy for all secrets (bypass tokens, API keys)
- No sensitive data in logs, source code, or error messages
- Security scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive audit logging for all security events
- Security headers implemented on all responses
- Security monitoring and alerting configured
- Incident response procedures documented

## Dependencies
- External secret management service integration
- CI/CD pipeline security tooling
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Security scanning service configuration

## Open Questions
- Secret rotation frequency and automation strategy
- Integration with external secret management services
- Compliance requirements and audit trail retention
- Security scanning tool selection and configuration
