# PBI-12: TypeScript Implementation for Better Type Safety

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-12)

## Overview
Migrate the current JavaScript implementation back to TypeScript to improve type safety, developer experience, and code maintainability while resolving the Edge Function compatibility issues that caused the initial migration to JavaScript.

## Problem Statement
The current JavaScript implementation lacks compile-time type checking, IDE intelligence, and self-documenting interfaces. This increases the risk of runtime errors, makes refactoring more dangerous, and reduces developer productivity. The original TypeScript implementation was abandoned due to Edge Function compilation issues, but these need to be resolved for long-term maintainability.

## User Stories
- As a Developer, I want type checking so I catch errors before deployment
- As a Maintainer, I want clear interfaces so I understand API contracts
- As a Team Member, I want IDE intelligence so I can code more efficiently
- As a Code Reviewer, I want type safety so I can review with confidence

## Technical Approach
1. **Edge Function Compatibility**: Research and resolve ES module cycle issues
2. **Gradual Migration**: Migrate endpoints one by one to minimize risk
3. **Type Definitions**: Create comprehensive type definitions for all data models
4. **Build Pipeline**: Set up TypeScript compilation and type checking
5. **Developer Experience**: Ensure hot reload and debugging work properly

### Migration Strategy
1. Investigate and resolve Edge Function TypeScript issues
2. Set up TypeScript configuration and build pipeline
3. Create shared type definitions
4. Migrate API endpoints incrementally
5. Update tests and documentation
6. Verify Edge Function deployment works

### Type Safety Goals
- Complete type coverage for all API endpoints
- Shared types between frontend and backend
- Compile-time validation of data structures
- Proper error handling with typed exceptions

## UX/UI Considerations
No direct UI impact. Improved type safety may prevent runtime errors that affect user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API endpoints implemented in TypeScript
- Type definitions for all data models and interfaces
- Edge Function compatibility resolved and verified
- Build pipeline with type checking in CI/CD
- No type errors in compilation
- Hot reload and debugging work in development
- Performance equivalent to JavaScript implementation

## Dependencies
- Resolution of Edge Function TypeScript compilation issues
- TypeScript toolchain and build configuration
- CI/CD pipeline updates for type checking

## Open Questions
- Root cause of original Edge Function ES module issues
- Best practices for TypeScript with Vercel Edge Functions
- Type sharing strategy between frontend and backend
- Migration timeline and risk mitigation
