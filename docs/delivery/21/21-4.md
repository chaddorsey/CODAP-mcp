## Requirements
- Implement logic to filter the tool registry by session capabilities
- Ensure only authorized tools are exposed for each session
- Update registry code for maintainability and extensibility
- Add tests to verify correct filtering for various capability sets

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the server tool registry to support filtering by session capabilities
2. Implement filtering logic in relevant endpoints (e.g., /metadata)
3. Refactor registry code for maintainability if needed
4. Add or update tests for registry filtering
5. Document the filtering logic and usage

## Verification
- Only authorized tools are exposed per session
- Tests pass for various capability sets
- Registry code is maintainable and documented

## Files Modified
- `server/tool-registry.js` or equivalent (registry filtering logic)
- `api/metadata.js` (endpoint filtering)
- `src/test/` (add/update filtering tests)
- Documentation as needed
