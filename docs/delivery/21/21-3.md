# 21-3 Secure Session Key Generation with Capability Context

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Update session key generation to be cryptographically secure and encode capability context, preventing spoofing and unauthorized tool access. This ensures that only authorized sessions can access the correct set of tools.

## Requirements
- Research and select a secure method for session key generation
- Encode capability context in the session key or associated metadata
- Prevent spoofing and unauthorized tool access
- Ensure session keys remain unique and unpredictable
- Add tests for key generation and validation

## Implementation Plan
1. Research secure key generation and encoding strategies
2. Update session creation logic to generate secure keys with capability context
3. Update server-side validation to check capability context
4. Add or update tests for key generation and validation
5. Document the new session key format and security considerations

## Verification
- Session keys are cryptographically secure and encode capability context
- Unauthorized tool access is prevented
- Tests pass for key generation and validation
- Documentation is updated

## Files Modified
- `api/sessions.js` (session key generation)
- `src/services/SessionService.ts` (plugin session logic)
- `src/test/services/SessionService.test.ts` (tests)
- Documentation as needed
