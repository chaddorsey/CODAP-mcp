# [18-6] Add session management with MCP headers

## Description

Enhance the existing MCP session management system to provide comprehensive session handling with proper MCP header support, session persistence, and integration with the legacy session system. While basic session management was implemented in task 18-5, this task focuses on robustness, edge cases, and advanced session features.

## Requirements

### **Core Session Management Enhancements**
1. **Session Resumption**: Handle client reconnections with existing session IDs
2. **Session Cleanup**: Implement proper session cleanup and garbage collection
3. **Session Validation**: Enhanced validation for malformed or expired sessions
4. **Concurrent Session Handling**: Support multiple concurrent sessions per client
5. **Session State Persistence**: Maintain session state across server restarts

### **MCP Header Support**
1. **Standard Headers**: Support all standard MCP headers (`mcp-session-id`, `mcp-client-info`)
2. **Custom Headers**: Support CODAP-specific session headers for backward compatibility
3. **Header Validation**: Validate and sanitize all incoming headers
4. **Response Headers**: Include appropriate session information in responses

### **Integration Requirements**
1. **Legacy Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing session system
2. **Browser Worker Integration**: Session sharing between MCP and browser worker systems
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of session-related errors
4. **Monitoring**: Session metrics and monitoring integration

### **Security Requirements**
1. **Session Isolation**: Ensure complete isolation between different sessions
2. **Session Hijacking Prevention**: Implement session security measures
3. **TTL Enforcement**: Strict enforcement of session timeouts
4. **Rate Limiting**: Per-session rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Session Enhancement (2 hours)**
- Enhance SessionManager with session resumption capabilities
- Add comprehensive session validation and error handling
- Implement session state persistence mechanisms
- Add session cleanup and garbage collection

### **Phase 2: Header Management (1 hour)**
- Implement comprehensive MCP header parsing and validation
- Add support for additional MCP standard headers
- Enhance response header generation
- Add header-based session routing

### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing (2 hours)**
- Test session resumption scenarios
- Validate concurrent session handling
- Test integration with browser worker system
- Performance testing with multiple sessions

### **Phase 4: Monitoring & Security (1 hour)**
- Add session monitoring and metrics
- Implement security measures and validation
- Add rate limiting per session
- Documentation and testing

## Verification

### **Session Management Tests**
- [x] Session creation with valid MCP headers
- [x] Session resumption after connection drop
- [x] Session expiration and cleanup
- [x] Concurrent session handling
- [x] Invalid session ID handling

### **Header Validation Tests**
- [x] Standard MCP headers parsed correctly
- [x] Invalid headers rejected gracefully
- [x] Response headers include session information
- [x] Legacy header compatibility maintained

### **Integration Tests**
- [x] MCP session works with browser worker
- [x] Session state persists across requests
- [x] Session isolation between different clients
- [x] Error handling for session failures

### **Security Tests**
- [x] Session hijacking prevention
- [x] TTL enforcement working correctly
- [x] Rate limiting per session
- [x] Session data isolation verified

## Files Modified

### **Core Session Management**
- `api/mcp.js` - Enhanced SessionManager class with comprehensive session lifecycle management
- `api/mcp-metrics.js` - Dedicated metrics endpoint for session monitoring

### **Enhanced Features Implemented**
- Enhanced SessionManager with session resumption, validation, and cleanup
- Comprehensive MCP header parsing and validation
- Rate limiting with per-session tracking
- Session metrics and monitoring endpoints
- CORS support for all MCP and legacy headers
- Error handling and logging improvements

### **Testing Files**
- `test-mcp-session-management.js` - Comprehensive session testing with 8 test scenarios

## Dependencies

- **Task 18-5**: MCP tool execution (completed)
- **PBI 1**: Session system foundation (completed)
- **PBI 3**: Browser worker integration (completed)

## Notes

This task builds upon the basic session management implemented in task 18-5, focusing on production-ready features like session resumption, proper cleanup, security measures, and comprehensive error handling. The goal is to make the session management system robust enough for production use with multiple concurrent MCP clients.
