# [18-5] Implement MCP tool execution

## Description

Implement the MCP `call_tool` method to enable actual execution of CODAP tools through the MCP protocol. This task completes the core MCP functionality by providing **dual-mode tool execution**: routing tool execution requests from MCP clients through the existing browser worker system OR direct server-side execution for immediate MCP client compatibility.

**Extended Scope**: During implementation, a critical gap was identified - MCP clients require direct tool execution without browser worker dependencies. This task now includes implementing a hybrid execution system that provides immediate tool execution for MCP clients while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing browser worker system.

## Requirements

Based on the MCP v1.0 specification and existing browser worker integration:

### MCP call_tool Method
- **Method**: `call_tool`
- **Purpose**: Execute specific tools with provided arguments
- **Input**: Tool name and arguments matching the tool's inputSchema
- **Output**: Tool execution results in MCP-compliant format
- **Session Validation**: Ensure client is initialized and tool exists

### Tool Execution Flow (Dual Mode)

**Mode 1: Browser Worker Execution** (Existing)
1. **Validation**: Verify tool exists and arguments match schema
2. **Session Mapping**: Convert MCP Session ID to legacy session code
3. **Request Queuing**: Route to existing browser worker queue system
4. **Response Handling**: Wait for browser worker response
5. **Format Conversion**: Transform response to MCP format

**Mode 2: Direct Server Execution** (New - Extended Scope)
1. **Validation**: Verify tool exists and arguments match schema
2. **Execution Detection**: Check if session has active browser worker
3. **Direct Execution**: Execute tool server-side using CODAP API simulation
4. **State Management**: Store/retrieve CODAP state in KV storage
5. **Response Formatting**: Return MCP-compliant response immediately

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **Browser Worker Bridge**: Use existing MCPToolBridge from task 18-2
- **Session Management**: Leverage session mapping system
- **KV Storage**: Use existing queue and response storage + new CODAP state storage
- **Tool Registry**: Execute tools registered in server initialization
- **Direct Execution Engine**: New server-side CODAP API simulation system
- **Hybrid Mode Detection**: Automatic selection between browser worker and direct execution

### Error Handling
- **Tool Not Found**: Return proper JSON-RPC error
- **Invalid Arguments**: Schema validation errors
- **Execution Timeout**: Handle browser worker timeouts
- **Session Errors**: Handle expired or invalid sessions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Tool Execution Bridge âœ… COMPLETE
1. Improve MCPToolBridge for robust tool execution
2. Add comprehensive argument validation
3. Enhance response formatting for MCP compliance
4. Add proper error handling and timeouts

### Phase 2: MCP call_tool Method âœ… COMPLETE
1. Implement `call_tool` method handler in MCP server
2. Add tool name validation against registered tools
3. Integrate with enhanced MCPToolBridge
4. Ensure proper JSON-RPC response format

### Phase 3: Response Transformation âœ… COMPLETE
1. Transform browser worker responses to MCP format
2. Handle different response types (text, JSON, errors)
3. Add execution metadata (timing, status)
4. Ensure compatibility with MCP client expectations

### Phase 4: Direct Tool Execution System ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
1. Create DirectToolExecutor class for server-side tool execution
2. Implement KV storage schema for CODAP state management
3. Build core tool implementations (createDataContext, createItems, etc.)
4. Add hybrid mode detection logic to choose execution method

### Phase 5: Integration Testing ðŸ“‹ PENDING
1. Test dual-mode execution with actual MCP clients
2. Verify end-to-end functionality from MCP to CODAP
3. Test error scenarios and edge cases for both modes
4. Validate performance and reliability for direct execution
