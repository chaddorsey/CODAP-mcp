   # Windows (PowerShell)
   New-Item -Path "$env:APPDATA\Claude" -ItemType Directory -Force
   ```
6. Edit config file and add the configuration:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   nano ~/.config/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   # Windows
   notepad "%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json"
   ```
7. Restart Claude Desktop
8. **Expected Result**: Claude Desktop shows CODAP tools in available MCP servers

3. **Expected Result**: Connection instructions copied to clipboard
4. Open Claude Desktop
5. Paste instructions into chat
6. **Expected Result**: Claude acknowledges connection and lists available CODAP tools

### Scenario 2: Data Creation Workflow (10 minutes)

**Objective**: Test complete data manipulation workflow via natural language

#### Step 2.1: Dataset Creation
1. Tell Claude: "Create a new dataset called 'StudentGrades' with columns: StudentName (text), MathScore (number), ScienceScore (number), Grade (text)"
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - Dataset appears in CODAP workspace
   - Table shows correct column structure
   - Claude confirms successful creation

#### Step 2.2: Data Population
1. Tell Claude: "Add sample data for 8 students with realistic names and scores"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - 8 rows of data appear in CODAP table
   - Names are realistic (not generic)
   - Scores are within reasonable ranges (0-100)
   - Grades correspond to score ranges

#### Step 2.3: Visualization Creation
1. Tell Claude: "Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between MathScore and ScienceScore"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Scatter plot component appears in CODAP
   - X-axis shows MathScore
   - Y-axis shows ScienceScore
   - Points represent individual students

#### Step 2.4: Data Analysis
1. Tell Claude: "Calculate the average math score and identify students scoring above average"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Claude provides calculated average
   - Lists specific students above average
   - May highlight these students in CODAP

#### Step 2.5: Data Filtering
1. Tell Claude: "Show only students with grades A or B"
2. **Expected Result**:
   - CODAP table filters to show subset
   - Visualizations update to reflect filtered data
   - Claude confirms filter applied

### Scenario 3: Error Handling and Recovery (5 minutes)

**Objective**: Test system behavior under error conditions

#### Step 3.1: Network Interruption
1. Disconnect internet connection
2. Tell Claude to perform a CODAP operation
3. **Expected Result**: Clear error message about connection failure
4. Reconnect internet
5. Retry operation
6. **Expected Result**: Operation succeeds after reconnection

#### Step 3.2: Invalid Operation
1. Tell Claude: "Delete all data from a nonexistent dataset called 'FakeData'"
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - Claude provides helpful error message
   - Suggests alternative actions
   - No error state in CODAP

#### Step 3.3: Session Timeout
1. Leave session idle for 15+ minutes
2. Attempt CODAP operation
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Session timeout error
   - Clear instructions to reconnect
   - Option to get new session ID

### Scenario 4: Multi-Session Testing (10 minutes)

**Objective**: Test session isolation with multiple CODAP instances

#### Step 4.1: Multiple CODAP Tabs
1. Open second CODAP tab in new browser window
2. Load CODAP plugin (different session ID)
3. Configure Claude with second session
4. **Expected Result**: Two independent CODAP workspaces

#### Step 4.2: Session Isolation Verification
1. Create different datasets in each session
2. Verify operations in one session don't affect the other
3. **Expected Result**: Complete isolation between sessions

#### Step 4.3: Claude Session Switching
1. Use Claude to connect to first session
2. Perform operations
3. Switch Claude to second session
4. Perform different operations
5. **Expected Result**: Claude can work with both sessions independently

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics
- **Plugin Load Time**: < 3 seconds
- **Session Creation**: < 2 seconds
- **Tool Discovery**: < 2 seconds (Claude Desktop)
- **Simple Operations**: < 5 seconds (create dataset, add data)

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### MCP Server Debugging
```bash
# Test MCP server directly
curl -X POST https://codap-aqzdjk77d-cdorsey-concordorgs-projects.vercel.app/api/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "mcp-session-id: TEST123" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

#### Claude Desktop Logs
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`
