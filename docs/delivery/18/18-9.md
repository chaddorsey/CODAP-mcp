# [18-9] Create backward compatibility layer

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Maintain existing API endpoints (`/api/metadata`, `/api/request`, `/api/response`, `/api/stream`) during the migration to MCP protocol to ensure existing integrations continue working.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-01-21 13:00:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | AI_Agent |
| 2025-01-21 13:05:00 | Scope Integration | Proposed | Done | Completed as part of task 18-7 extended scope | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

### **Existing API Preservation**
1. **Metadata Endpoint**: `/api/metadata` continues to return tool manifest
2. **Request Endpoint**: `/api/request` accepts tool execution requests
3. **Response Endpoint**: `/api/response` provides tool execution results
4. **Stream Endpoint**: `/api/stream` maintains SSE functionality
5. **Session Management**: Existing session creation and management

### **Dual Protocol Support**
1. **Parallel Operation**: Both custom API and MCP endpoint work simultaneously
2. **Session Compatibility**: Sessions work with both protocol types
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing browser worker integration unchanged
4. **Migration Path**: Clear upgrade path from custom API to MCP

## Implementation Plan

This task was **completed as part of task 18-7's extended scope**. The implementation included:

1. **Preserved Existing APIs**: All current endpoints maintained without changes
2. **Added MCP Endpoint**: New `/api/mcp` endpoint alongside existing APIs
3. **Shared Session System**: Both protocols use same session management
4. **Dual-Mode Tool Execution**: Tools work via both custom API and MCP protocol

## Verification

✅ **All verification criteria met as part of task 18-7:**

### **API Endpoint Preservation**
- ✅ `/api/metadata` returns tool manifest as before
- ✅ `/api/request` accepts tool requests unchanged
- ✅ `/api/response` provides results as expected
- ✅ `/api/stream` maintains SSE functionality
- ✅ Session endpoints work unchanged

### **Dual Protocol Operation**
- ✅ Custom API and MCP protocol work simultaneously
- ✅ Sessions compatible with both protocols
- ✅ Browser worker integration unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

### **Integration Tests**
- ✅ Existing browser worker tests continue passing
- ✅ Custom API functionality verified
- ✅ MCP protocol functionality verified
- ✅ Session compatibility across protocols confirmed

## Files Modified

**Completed as part of task 18-7:**
- `api/mcp.js` - New MCP endpoint added alongside existing APIs
- Existing API files unchanged (preserved backward compatibility)

## Dependencies

- **Task 18-7**: StreamableHTTP transport (completed with extended scope)
- **PBI 3**: Browser worker integration (preserved compatibility)

## Implementation Notes

This task was absorbed into task 18-7's extended scope as backward compatibility was a core requirement for the MCP implementation. The approach taken was:

**Additive Implementation**: Rather than replacing existing APIs, the new MCP endpoint was added alongside them, ensuring zero breaking changes.

**Shared Infrastructure**: Both protocols share the same:
- Session management system
- Tool execution pipeline  
- KV storage for state
- Browser worker integration

**Migration Strategy**: Existing users can continue using custom APIs while new integrations can use the MCP-compliant endpoint. This provides a smooth migration path without forcing immediate changes.

The implementation ensures complete backward compatibility while enabling MCP protocol adoption.
