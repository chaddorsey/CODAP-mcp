## Requirements
- Translation functions for all new SageModeler tools
- Relay plugin routes tool calls to correct API endpoints
- Integration with existing CODAP tool logic

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement translation functions for each new SageModeler tool
2. Integrate translation logic into the relay plugin
3. Ensure routing logic distinguishes between CODAP and SageModeler tools
4. Test integration with both toolsets

## Verification
- Relay plugin correctly routes and translates all tool calls
- Integration with CODAP tools remains functional
- Output reviewed and approved by project lead
