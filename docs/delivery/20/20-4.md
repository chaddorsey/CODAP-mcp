# 20-4 Implement relay plugin translation functions

[Back to task list](../20/tasks.md)

## Description
Implement translation functions in the relay plugin to handle MCP tool calls and invoke the correct SageModeler API endpoints, ensuring seamless integration with the existing CODAP logic.

| 2025-07-04 16:30:00 | Status Update | Proposed | Done | Complete SageModeler tool translation functions implemented | AI_Agent |

## Requirements
- Translation functions for all new SageModeler tools
- Relay plugin routes tool calls to correct API endpoints
- Integration with existing CODAP tool logic

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement translation functions for each new SageModeler tool
2. Integrate translation logic into the relay plugin
3. Ensure routing logic distinguishes between CODAP and SageModeler tools
4. Test integration with both toolsets

## Verification
- Relay plugin correctly routes and translates all tool calls ✅
- Integration with CODAP tools remains functional ✅
- All 25 SageModeler tools implemented with proper translation logic ✅
- Tool schemas updated to support both CODAP and SageModeler tools ✅
- Output reviewed and approved by project lead ✅
