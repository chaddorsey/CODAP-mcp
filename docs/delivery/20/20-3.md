## Requirements
- MCP tool definitions for all SageModeler functions (name, description, parameters, schema)
- Tool registry updated to include new tools alongside CODAP tools
- No conflicts or duplication in tool names

## Implementation Plan
1. Use the output from 20-1 and 20-2 to define MCP tool objects for each SageModeler function
2. Add new tool definitions to the tool registry file
3. Ensure registry supports both CODAP and SageModeler tools
4. Review and test registry integration

## Verification
- All SageModeler tools are present in the registry with correct schemas
- Registry supports both toolsets without conflict
- Output reviewed and approved by project lead
