# 20-2 Map each function to SageModeler API calls and define translation logic

[Back to task list](../20/tasks.md)

## Description
For each audited function, document the corresponding SageModeler API call (endpoint, method, payload) and define translation logic from MCP tool parameters to SageModeler API requests.

## Requirements
- For each function from 20-1, document the corresponding SageModeler API call
- Define translation logic from MCP tool parameters to API request format
- Reference to source: `design/reference/OpenAPI-schema.md` and `design/reference/sage-api-plugin.html`

## Implementation Plan
1. For each function from 20-1, identify the corresponding SageModeler API endpoint, method, and payload
2. Document the mapping and translation logic
3. Organize mappings in a structured format (table or mapping file)
4. Review for completeness and accuracy

## Verification
- Each function from 20-1 has a documented API mapping and translation logic
- Mapping reviewed and approved by project lead
