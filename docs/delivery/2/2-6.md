## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- WCAG AA compliance for all banner elements
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility with proper announcements
- ARIA-live announcements for timer updates and status changes
- Accessible color contrast ratios (â‰¥4.5:1)
- Keyboard shortcuts for copy actions
- Focus management and visible focus indicators
- Alternative text for any visual indicators

### Technical Requirements
- Implement ARIA attributes (role, aria-label, aria-live, aria-describedby)
- Add proper semantic HTML structure
- Support keyboard event handlers for all interactive elements
- Implement focus trap if needed for modal-like behavior
- Add screen reader testing support
- Include accessibility testing utilities in component tests

### Quality Requirements
- WCAG AA audit with automated and manual testing
- Screen reader testing with at least one assistive technology
- Keyboard navigation testing across different browsers
- Color contrast verification for all visual elements
- Performance testing to ensure accessibility features don't impact performance

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Accessibility Audit & Planning
1. Review current component for accessibility gaps
2. Plan ARIA structure and semantic HTML improvements
3. Design keyboard navigation flow and shortcuts
4. Plan screen reader announcement strategy

### Phase 2: ARIA & Semantic Implementation
1. Add appropriate ARIA roles and labels to all elements
2. Implement ARIA-live regions for dynamic updates
3. Add semantic HTML structure improvements
4. Create accessible button labels and descriptions

### Phase 3: Keyboard Navigation
1. Implement keyboard event handlers for all interactive elements
2. Add focus management and visible focus indicators
3. Create keyboard shortcuts for copy actions
4. Test tab order and focus flow

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Run automated accessibility testing tools
2. Conduct manual screen reader testing
3. Perform comprehensive keyboard navigation testing
4. Verify color contrast and visual accessibility
5. Create accessibility documentation

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that the pairing banner meets WCAG AA accessibility standards and works effectively with assistive technologies.

**Test Scope**: ARIA implementation, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and semantic HTML structure.

**Environment & Setup**: Accessibility testing tools (axe-core, WAVE), screen reader software (NVDA/JAWS), keyboard-only testing, and color contrast analyzers.

**Mocking Strategy**: Test with real assistive technologies rather than mocking, use accessibility testing libraries for automated checks.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Screen Reader Navigation**: All content is properly announced and navigable
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality accessible via keyboard only
3. **ARIA Announcements**: Timer updates and status changes are announced appropriately
4. **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
5. **Focus Management**: Focus indicators are visible and logical
6. **Semantic Structure**: HTML structure supports assistive technology navigation
7. **Interactive Elements**: All buttons and controls are properly labeled and accessible

**Success Criteria**: 
- WCAG AA audit passes with no violations
- Screen reader testing completes successfully
- Keyboard navigation covers 100% of functionality
- Color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1
- Automated accessibility tests pass
- Manual testing confirms usability with assistive technologies

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Complete banner navigation using only keyboard
2. Navigate banner using screen reader
3. Verify all announcements are appropriate and timely
4. Check focus indicators are visible and logical
5. Confirm color contrast meets requirements
