# [2-8] E2E CoS Test

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create comprehensive end-to-end tests that verify all Conditions of Satisfaction (CoS) for PBI 2 are met. This task validates the complete pairing banner functionality from user perspective, ensuring the banner works correctly in real CODAP environment and meets all acceptance criteria.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- End-to-end tests covering all PBI 2 acceptance criteria
- Tests run in real CODAP environment with live relay API
- Comprehensive user journey testing from plugin load to session usage
- Cross-browser testing for all major browsers
- Mobile and responsive testing scenarios
- Accessibility testing with assistive technologies
- Performance testing for banner loading and responsiveness

### Technical Requirements
- Use Playwright for browser automation and testing
- Test against real relay API endpoints (from PBI 1)
- Support for multiple browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Implement proper test data setup and cleanup
- Include visual regression testing for design consistency
- Support for CI/CD integration and automated test runs

### Quality Requirements
- Tests cover 100% of PBI 2 Conditions of Satisfaction
- Reliable test execution with minimal flakiness
- Clear test reporting and failure diagnostics
- Performance benchmarks for banner functionality
- Comprehensive coverage of error scenarios and edge cases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Test Framework Setup
1. Set up Playwright test configuration for CODAP environment
2. Create test utilities for CODAP plugin testing
3. Implement test data management and API setup
4. Configure cross-browser and responsive testing

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Tests
1. Test banner visibility and loading on plugin startup
2. Verify 8-character session code display and validity
3. Test countdown timer accuracy and updates
4. Validate copy code and copy prompt functionality
5. Test session renewal and expiration handling

### Phase 3: Accessibility & UX Tests
1. Test WCAG AA compliance with automated tools
2. Verify keyboard navigation and shortcuts
3. Test screen reader compatibility and announcements
4. Validate responsive design across device sizes
5. Test visual feedback and user interaction patterns

### Phase 4: Integration & Performance Tests
1. Test integration with relay API endpoints
2. Verify error handling for network failures
3. Test performance under various load conditions
4. Validate banner behavior during CODAP interactions
5. Test plugin lifecycle and banner cleanup

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Comprehensively verify that all PBI 2 Conditions of Satisfaction are met through end-to-end testing in real CODAP environment.

**Test Scope**: Complete pairing banner functionality, user experience, accessibility, performance, and integration with CODAP and relay systems.

**Environment & Setup**: Real CODAP environment, live relay API, Playwright test framework, and cross-browser testing infrastructure.

**Mocking Strategy**: Minimize mocking - use real systems where possible, mock only external dependencies outside the scope of this PBI.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Banner Visibility**: Banner visible on plugin load with 8-character code ✅
2. **Timer Functionality**: Countdown timer updates regularly and displays correctly ✅
3. **Copy Actions**: Copy prompt includes code, relay URL, and instructions ✅
4. **Accessibility**: UX meets accessibility spec with WCAG AA compliance ✅
5. **Session Management**: Banner handles session creation, renewal, and expiration
6. **Error Handling**: Banner gracefully handles API failures and network issues
7. **Responsive Design**: Banner works correctly across device sizes
8. **Performance**: Banner loads quickly and doesn't impact CODAP performance
9. **Cross-Browser**: Functionality works consistently across major browsers

**Success Criteria**: 
- All PBI 2 Conditions of Satisfaction verified ✅
- Tests pass consistently across all target browsers
- Accessibility requirements verified with assistive technology testing
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed requirements
- Zero critical or high-severity defects in acceptance testing
- User journey flows complete successfully end-to-end

### Automated Test Coverage
- Plugin loading and banner initialization
- Session code generation and display
- Timer countdown and visual updates
- Copy functionality with clipboard verification
- Error state handling and recovery
- Responsive layout across breakpoints
- Accessibility compliance verification

### Manual Test Coverage
- Screen reader navigation and announcements
- Keyboard-only navigation
- Visual design integration with CODAP
- Cross-browser visual consistency
- Performance under real usage conditions
