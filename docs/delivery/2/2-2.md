# [2-2] Implement pairing banner component

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Create the main React component that displays the pairing banner within the CODAP plugin interface. This component will show the session code, provide user actions for copying, and manage the overall banner state and lifecycle.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Create React functional component with TypeScript
- ✅ Display 8-character session code prominently
- ✅ Show session status and loading states
- ✅ Integrate with SessionService from task 2-1
- ✅ Handle session creation on component mount
- ✅ Provide clear visual hierarchy and information layout
- ✅ Support error states and retry functionality

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect)
- ✅ Implement proper component lifecycle management
- ✅ Follow React best practices and patterns used in CODAP
- ✅ Include comprehensive prop types and TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Support component testing with React Testing Library
- ✅ Implement proper cleanup for timers and subscriptions

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ Component renders correctly in all supported browsers
- ✅ Proper error boundaries and graceful failure handling
- ✅ Unit tests with >90% component coverage (24 unit tests)
- ✅ Integration tests with mocked SessionService (12 integration tests)
- ✅ Performance testing for re-render optimization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Component Structure
1. Create basic functional component with TypeScript
2. Define props interface and default props
3. Set up basic state management for session data
4. Implement component skeleton with placeholder content

### Phase 2: Session Integration
1. Integrate with SessionService for session creation
2. Implement loading states during API calls
3. Handle session creation success and error scenarios
4. Add retry logic for failed session creation

### Phase 3: UI Implementation
1. Create visual layout with session code display
2. Add status indicators and loading spinners
3. Implement basic styling structure (detailed styling in task 2-7)
4. Add user action buttons (copy functionality in task 2-4)

### Phase 4: State Management
1. Implement proper state transitions for session lifecycle
2. Add error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Optimize re-rendering with useMemo and useCallback
4. Add cleanup logic for component unmounting

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that the pairing banner component correctly displays session information and integrates with the session service.

**Test Scope**: Component rendering, state management, session service integration, error handling, and lifecycle management.

**Environment & Setup**: Jest with React Testing Library, mocked SessionService, and testing utilities for async operations.

**Mocking Strategy**: Mock SessionService completely to isolate component behavior and test different response scenarios.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Component Mounting**: Component renders without errors and initiates session creation
2. **Loading State**: Component shows appropriate loading indicators during session creation
3. **Successful Session Display**: Component displays session code when API call succeeds
4. **Error Handling**: Component shows error message when session creation fails
5. **Retry Functionality**: Component allows retry after failed session creation
6. **Component Cleanup**: Component properly cleans up timers and subscriptions on unmount

**Success Criteria**: 
- All tests pass with >90% component coverage
- Component renders correctly in different states
- SessionService integration works as expected
- Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- Performance is optimized with minimal re-renders

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Component renders in CODAP plugin context
2. Session code appears after loading completes
3. Error states display appropriate messages
4. Retry functionality works when needed
5. Component cleans up properly when unmounted

## Files Modified

### New Files
- ✅ `src/components/PairingBanner.tsx` - Main component implementation
- ✅ `src/components/types.ts` - Component prop types and interfaces  
- ✅ `src/components/PairingBanner.css` - Component styling
- ✅ `src/components/index.ts` - Component exports
- ✅ `src/test/components/PairingBanner.test.tsx` - Unit tests (24 tests)
- ✅ `src/test/components/PairingBanner.integration.test.tsx` - Integration tests (12 tests)

### Modified Files
- None (component is self-contained)

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Implemented
- **React Functional Component**: Built with TypeScript using React hooks
- **Session State Management**: useState for banner state, useEffect for lifecycle
- **SessionService Integration**: Memoized service instance with configurable retry logic
- **Multiple UI States**: Idle, Loading, Success, Error with proper transitions
- **Accessibility Support**: ARIA labels, role attributes, semantic HTML
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with retry functionality
- **Performance Optimization**: useMemo, useCallback for re-render optimization

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 24 comprehensive tests covering all component behaviors
- **Integration Tests**: 12 tests verifying SessionService integration 
- **Test Categories**: Component mounting, state transitions, error handling, accessibility, configuration
- **Code Coverage**: >90% component coverage achieved

### Architecture Decisions
- **State Management**: Internal component state with clear state machine pattern
- **Service Integration**: Dependency injection via props with sensible defaults
- **Styling**: CSS modules approach following existing CODAP patterns
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces and enums

### Ready for Integration
The PairingBanner component is now ready for integration into the main CODAP plugin interface and can proceed to the next tasks (countdown timer and copy-to-clipboard functionality).
