# [2-1] Create session service API client

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Build a TypeScript service module that provides a clean API for communicating with the relay endpoints established in PBI 1. This service will handle session creation, status checking, and error management for the pairing banner component.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Create TypeScript service class for relay API communication
- ✅ Implement session creation endpoint calls
- ✅ Handle session status checking and validation
- ✅ Provide error handling and retry logic for network failures
- ✅ Support configuration of relay base URL
- ✅ Include proper TypeScript type definitions for all API responses

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Use fetch API for HTTP requests
- ✅ Implement proper error boundaries and timeout handling
- ✅ Follow established code patterns from existing CODAP plugin architecture
- ✅ Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- ✅ Support both production and development relay URLs

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ 100% TypeScript coverage with strict typing
- ✅ Unit tests covering all public methods and error scenarios
- ✅ Integration tests verifying API contract compliance
- ✅ Error handling tests for network failures and invalid responses

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Type Definitions ✅
1. ✅ Define TypeScript interfaces for:
   - Session creation request/response
   - Session status response
   - Error response structures
   - Service configuration options

### Phase 2: Core Service Implementation ✅
1. ✅ Create `SessionService` class with constructor accepting configuration
2. ✅ Implement `createSession()` method calling `POST /api/sessions`
3. ✅ Implement `isValidSession()` method for session validation
4. ✅ Add proper error handling with custom error types

### Phase 3: Integration Support ✅
1. ✅ Add service configuration management
2. ✅ Implement request/response logging for debugging
3. ✅ Add timeout and retry logic for reliability
4. ✅ Create service factory for dependency injection

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation ✅
1. ✅ Write comprehensive unit tests using Jest
2. ✅ Create integration tests with mock API responses
3. ✅ Document all public methods and configuration options
4. ✅ Add usage examples in comments

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that the session service correctly handles all relay API interactions with proper error handling and type safety.

**Test Scope**: SessionService class methods, error handling, configuration management, and API integration patterns.

**Environment & Setup**: Jest testing environment with fetch mocking for API responses.

**Mocking Strategy**: Mock fetch API to simulate various relay API responses including success, error, timeout, and network failure scenarios.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ **Successful Session Creation**: Service calls POST /api/sessions and returns proper session object
2. ✅ **Session Status Checking**: Service validates existing sessions and handles status responses
3. ✅ **Network Error Handling**: Service properly handles connection failures and timeouts
4. ✅ **Invalid Response Handling**: Service handles malformed or unexpected API responses
5. ✅ **Configuration Management**: Service accepts and uses different base URLs and options
6. ✅ **TypeScript Compliance**: All methods have proper type annotations and return correct types

**Success Criteria**: 
- ✅ All tests pass with >95% code coverage
- ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds with strict mode
- ✅ Integration tests verify API contract compliance
- ✅ Error scenarios are handled gracefully without crashes

### Manual Verification Steps
1. ✅ Service instantiates without errors
2. ✅ createSession() successfully calls relay API
3. ✅ Error responses are properly typed and handled
4. ✅ Service configuration works with different environments
5. ✅ All methods return properly typed responses

## Files Modified

### New Files
- ✅ `src/services/SessionService.ts` - Main service implementation
- ✅ `src/services/types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions (enhanced)
- ✅ `src/services/index.ts` - Service exports
- ✅ `src/test/services/SessionService.test.ts` - Unit tests
- ✅ `src/test/services/SessionService.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests

### Implementation Summary

**Core Features Implemented:**
- Full TypeScript service class with proper error handling
- Session creation with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Session code validation using Base32 format (A-Z, 2-7)
- Configurable timeouts, retry attempts, and retry delays
- Comprehensive error types and error code mapping
- Factory function for easy service instantiation

**Test Coverage:**
- 15 unit tests covering all major functionality
- Integration tests for API contract compliance
- Error scenario testing including network failures, timeouts, and invalid responses
- Session code validation testing with valid Base32 codes

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- Used fetch API with AbortController for timeout handling
- Implemented exponential backoff for network error retries
- Created typed error classes for different failure scenarios
- Separated concerns with dedicated types file
- Used factory pattern for flexible service instantiation

The implementation successfully provides a robust, well-tested TypeScript service for communicating with the relay API endpoints, ready for use by the pairing banner component in subsequent tasks.
