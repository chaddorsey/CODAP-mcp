## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Integration with CODAP design system and theming
- Visual hierarchy that emphasizes session code and key actions
- State-based styling (loading, active, warning, error, expired)
- Smooth animations and transitions for better user experience
- Modern, clean design that feels integrated with CODAP interface
- Support for both light and dark themes if applicable

### Technical Requirements
- Use CSS-in-JS or CSS modules for component styling
- Implement responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Follow CODAP's existing styling patterns and conventions
- Support CSS custom properties for theming
- Optimize for performance with minimal CSS bundle size
- Ensure styles don't conflict with existing CODAP styles

### Quality Requirements
- Visual design meets modern UI/UX standards
- Responsive design tested on multiple device sizes
- Performance impact minimal on component rendering
- Cross-browser compatibility for styling
- Accessibility compliance for visual elements (contrast, sizing)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Design System Integration
1. Research CODAP's existing design system and patterns
2. Create component style architecture and structure
3. Define color palette, typography, and spacing systems
4. Plan responsive breakpoints and layout strategies

### Phase 2: Core Component Styling
1. Implement base component layout and structure
2. Add session code display styling with proper emphasis
3. Style action buttons with consistent design language
4. Create loading state and spinner animations

### Phase 3: Responsive & Interactive Design
1. Implement responsive layout for different screen sizes
2. Add hover, focus, and active states for interactive elements
3. Create smooth transitions and micro-animations
4. Style timer and countdown display with visual hierarchy

### Phase 4: State & Theme Support
1. Implement state-based styling (active, warning, error, expired)
2. Add support for theme variations if needed
3. Create visual feedback for copy actions and state changes
4. Optimize and test cross-browser compatibility

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that the pairing banner design is visually appealing, responsive, and integrates well with CODAP interface.

**Test Scope**: Visual design, responsive behavior, state styling, animations, and cross-browser compatibility.

**Environment & Setup**: Browser testing across different screen sizes, visual regression testing tools, and cross-browser testing setup.

**Mocking Strategy**: Test with various component states and props to verify styling behavior across all scenarios.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Responsive Design**: Component layouts correctly at mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes
2. **Visual Integration**: Component looks cohesive within CODAP interface
3. **State Styling**: All component states (loading, active, warning, error) display correctly
4. **Interactive Elements**: Buttons and interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus styles
5. **Animations**: Transitions and animations are smooth and performant
6. **Cross-Browser**: Styling works consistently across major browsers
7. **Accessibility**: Visual elements meet accessibility requirements

**Success Criteria**: 
- Responsive design works flawlessly across target screen sizes
- Visual design integrates seamlessly with CODAP interface
- All component states have appropriate visual styling
- Interactive elements provide clear visual feedback
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Performance impact is minimal

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Test component appearance at different screen sizes
2. Verify integration with CODAP interface design
3. Check all interactive states and animations
4. Test cross-browser visual consistency
5. Validate accessibility of visual design elements
