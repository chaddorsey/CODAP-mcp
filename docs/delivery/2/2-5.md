# [2-5] Integrate with CODAP plugin system

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Add the PairingBanner component to the existing App.tsx component structure so it displays within the CODAP plugin interface. This task involves modifying the current App component to include the banner, ensuring it appears at the right time during plugin initialization, and making sure it doesn't interfere with existing CODAP functionality.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Add PairingBanner component to App.tsx component structure
- Position banner prominently within the existing plugin interface layout
- Ensure banner initializes after CODAP plugin initialization is complete
- Make sure banner doesn't conflict with existing CODAP functions section
- Handle banner state management within the App component context
- Ensure banner appears above or alongside existing sections (CODAP Functions, MCP Tools)

### Technical Requirements
- Use existing CODAP plugin API and patterns
- Follow established component hierarchy and mounting points
- Implement proper plugin initialization sequence
- Support both development and production CODAP environments
- Handle CODAP plugin messaging if required
- Maintain compatibility with existing CODAP plugin structure

### Quality Requirements
- Integration tests with CODAP plugin environment
- Component renders correctly in CODAP context
- No conflicts with existing CODAP functionality
- Performance meets CODAP plugin standards
- Proper error handling in CODAP environment

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: App Component Analysis
1. Review current App.tsx structure and component organization
2. Identify best placement for PairingBanner within existing layout
3. Understand current initialization sequence and state management
4. Plan banner integration with minimal disruption to existing features

### Phase 2: Component Integration
1. Import PairingBanner component in App.tsx
2. Add banner to JSX structure in appropriate location (likely at top)
3. Ensure banner state doesn't conflict with existing App state
4. Test that banner appears correctly within CODAP plugin window

### Phase 3: Plugin Lifecycle Management
1. Implement proper plugin startup sequence
2. Handle banner initialization after CODAP is ready
3. Add cleanup logic for plugin shutdown/unmounting
4. Support plugin hot-reloading in development

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
1. Test banner in both development and production CODAP
2. Verify integration with existing plugin functionality
3. Test plugin loading performance and startup time
4. Validate banner behavior in different CODAP contexts

## Verification

### Test Plan
**Objective**: Verify that the pairing banner integrates seamlessly with CODAP plugin architecture and lifecycle.

**Test Scope**: Component integration, plugin lifecycle, CODAP environment compatibility, and performance impact.

**Environment & Setup**: CODAP development environment, plugin testing framework, and integration testing tools.

**Mocking Strategy**: Mock CODAP environment where needed for unit tests, use real CODAP instance for integration tests.

**Key Test Scenarios**:
1. **Plugin Loading**: Banner appears correctly when plugin loads in CODAP
2. **Lifecycle Management**: Banner handles plugin initialization and cleanup properly
3. **Environment Compatibility**: Component works in both dev and production CODAP
4. **Performance Impact**: Banner integration doesn't negatively affect plugin performance
5. **Error Handling**: Plugin handles banner errors gracefully without breaking CODAP
6. **Hot Reloading**: Banner supports development hot-reloading workflow

**Success Criteria**: 
- Banner appears correctly in CODAP interface
- Plugin loads and initializes without errors
- No performance degradation in CODAP startup
- Integration tests pass in real CODAP environment
- Banner functionality works seamlessly with CODAP

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Plugin loads successfully in CODAP
2. Banner appears in expected location
3. Banner functionality works within CODAP context
4. Plugin hot-reloading works in development
5. No conflicts with existing CODAP features

## Files Modified

### New Files
- Integration tests for CODAP environment

### Modified Files
- Main plugin entry point file (likely in `src/`)
- Plugin configuration files
- Component export/import structure
- Possibly CODAP plugin manifest or configuration
