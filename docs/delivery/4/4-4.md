# 4-4 Implement version management

## Description
Add API versioning to manifest responses to ensure backward compatibility and clear version communication for LLM agents. This will enable controlled evolution of the metadata API and tool manifest schema while maintaining compatibility with existing integrations.

## Requirements
- Add version information to metadata API responses (both HTTP headers and response body)
- Implement semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for the tool manifest schema
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing API consumers
- Add API version validation to ensure clients can handle the response format
- Document version management strategy and breaking change policy
- Support version negotiation through request headers (optional)

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Completed Implementation

**Version Constants (Completed)**
- Added `API_VERSION = "1.0.0"` constant for current API version
- Added `TOOL_MANIFEST_VERSION = "1.0.0"` constant for tool manifest version  
- Added `SUPPORTED_API_VERSIONS = ["1.0.0"]` array for supported API versions
- Added `SUPPORTED_MANIFEST_VERSIONS = ["1.0.0"]` array for supported manifest versions

**HTTP Headers (Completed)**
- Added `API-Version` header with current API version
- Added `Tool-Manifest-Version` header with current tool manifest version
- Added `Supported-Versions` header with comma-separated list of supported API versions
- Updated CORS headers to include `Accept-Version` in allowed headers

**Response Body Enhancement (Completed)**
- Added `apiVersion` field to response body
- Added `toolManifestVersion` field to response body  
- Added `supportedVersions` object with `api` and `toolManifest` arrays
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing response structure

**Version Negotiation (Completed)**
- Added optional `Accept-Version` header processing
- Returns 406 Not Acceptable for unsupported versions with descriptive error message
- Maintains backward compatibility when no `Accept-Version` header is provided

**Testing (Completed)**
- Created comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases covering:
  - Version headers verification
  - Response body version fields
  - Version negotiation scenarios
  - HTTP method handling
  - Error handling
  - Tool manifest structure validation
- All tests passing successfully

## Verification

### Test Results
✅ All 12 unit tests passing
✅ Version management test script confirms all features implemented
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ Error handling for unsupported versions working correctly

### Implementation Verification
- Version constants properly defined and used consistently
- HTTP headers include all required version information
- Response body includes version fields without breaking existing structure
- Version negotiation with Accept-Version header implemented
- Comprehensive test coverage achieved

## Files Modified

1. **api/metadata.js**
   - Added version management constants at top of file
   - Enhanced handler function with version headers
   - Added version negotiation logic
   - Enhanced response body with version information
   - Updated CORS headers to support Accept-Version

2. **src/test/api/metadata.test.js** (Created)
   - Comprehensive test suite for version management
   - 12 test cases covering all functionality
   - Mocked dependencies for isolated testing
   - Tests for headers, response body, negotiation, and error handling

3. **test-version-management.js** (Created)
   - Standalone analysis script for version management
   - Verifies implementation completeness
   - Documents all implemented features
