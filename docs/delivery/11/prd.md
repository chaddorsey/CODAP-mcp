# PBI-11: Proper Environment Variable Management

[View in Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-11)

## Overview
Implement secure, environment-specific configuration management using Vercel environment variables to replace hardcoded values and enable proper separation between development, staging, and production environments.

## Problem Statement
Current implementation has hardcoded configuration values visible in source code, no environment separation, and security risks from exposed sensitive values. This prevents secure deployment practices and proper environment management.

## User Stories
- As a Platform Engineer, I want sensitive values stored securely so they don't appear in source code
- As DevOps, I want environment-specific configurations so dev/staging/prod behave appropriately
- As a Security Engineer, I want no secrets in source code so the attack surface is minimized
- As a Developer, I want validated configuration on startup so misconfigurations are caught early

## Technical Approach
1. **Environment Variables**: Move all configuration to Vercel environment variables
2. **Environment Separation**: Different configs for dev/staging/production
3. **Configuration Validation**: Startup checks for required variables
4. **Security Best Practices**: No sensitive data in source code or logs

### Configuration Categories
- **Environment Settings**: TTL values, rate limits, CORS origins, API URLs
- **Feature Flags**: Debug modes, demo features, monitoring levels
- **Service URLs**: External service endpoints, callback URLs
- **Non-Secret Configuration**: Environment-specific settings that are not sensitive

**Note**: Secret management (API keys, tokens) is handled in PBI-13 (Comprehensive Secrets Management)

### Implementation Plan
1. Define configuration schema and validation
2. Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Replace hardcoded values with environment variable reads
4. Implement configuration validation on startup
5. Update deployment scripts and documentation

## UX/UI Considerations
No direct UI impact. May enable environment-specific features and better error messages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod) for non-secret values
- No hardcoded configuration values in source code (excluding secrets - see PBI-13)
- Configuration validation on function startup for non-secret settings
- Documentation for all required environment variables (non-secret)
- CI/CD pipeline validates environment setup for configuration
- Clear separation between secret and non-secret environment variables

## Dependencies
- Vercel environment variable configuration
- CI/CD pipeline updates
- Documentation updates

## Open Questions
- Configuration naming conventions and organization
- Environment variable encryption and access control
- Development workflow for local testing with environment variables
