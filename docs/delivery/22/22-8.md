# [22-8] Node Property Validation and Change Tracking

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement comprehensive property validation, change tracking, and button state management for node operations. This task focuses on enhancing the user experience by providing real-time validation feedback, tracking changes efficiently, and managing button states based on form validity and change status.

## Requirements

### Primary Requirements
1. **Real-time Property Validation**
   - Title validation (required, minimum length, maximum length)
   - Initial value validation (numeric constraints)
   - Position validation (numeric constraints, minimum values)
   - Color validation (valid hex color format)
   - URL validation for image fields
   - String length validation for text fields

2. **Advanced Validation Rules**
   - Conditional validation based on property combinations
   - Cross-field validation (e.g., position constraints)
   - Business rule validation (e.g., accumulator constraints)
   - Custom validation for advanced properties

3. **Comprehensive Change Tracking**
   - Deep comparison of nested objects
   - Change detection for all property types
   - Granular change tracking per field
   - Change history for debugging
   - Efficient change detection to prevent unnecessary renders

4. **Smart Button State Management**
   - Enable/disable Create button based on form validity
   - Enable/disable Update button based on changes and validity
   - Enable/disable Delete button based on selection state
   - Loading states during operations
   - Clear visual feedback for button states

5. **User Feedback and Error Display**
   - Field-level error messages
   - Form-level validation summary
   - Real-time feedback as user types
   - Clear indication of required fields
   - Accessibility-compliant error messaging

### Secondary Requirements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Debounced validation for real-time feedback
   - Memoized validation functions
   - Efficient change detection algorithms
   - Minimal re-renders during validation

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Progressive validation (validate as user progresses)
   - Smart error recovery suggestions
   - Contextual help for validation rules
   - Visual indication of valid/invalid states

3. **Extensibility**
   - Pluggable validation system
   - Custom validation rule support
   - Configurable validation messages
   - Support for future property types

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Validation Framework
1. Create comprehensive validation utility functions
2. Implement field-level validation rules
3. Add cross-field validation support
4. Create validation error messaging system

### Phase 2: Change Tracking Enhancement
1. Implement deep object comparison utilities
2. Create granular change tracking system
3. Add change history management
4. Optimize change detection performance

### Phase 3: Button State Management
1. Enhance button state logic based on validation
2. Implement loading state management
3. Add visual feedback for button states
4. Integrate with existing CRUD operations

### Phase 4: User Interface Integration
1. Add real-time validation feedback to forms
2. Implement field-level error display
3. Create form-level validation summary
4. Enhance accessibility for validation feedback

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Validation rule functions for all property types
- Change tracking algorithms and deep comparison
- Button state management logic
- Error message generation and formatting

### Integration Tests
- Form validation with user input simulation
- Change tracking across form interactions
- Button state changes during operations
- Error display and recovery workflows

### UI Tests
- Real-time validation feedback display
- Error message accessibility and clarity
- Button state visual feedback
- Form submission prevention with invalid data

## Verification

### Success Criteria
1. All form fields have appropriate validation rules
2. Real-time validation feedback works smoothly
3. Change tracking accurately detects modifications
4. Button states reflect form validity and change status
5. Error messages are clear and actionable
6. Validation performance is optimized
7. User experience is smooth and intuitive

### Acceptance Tests
1. Test validation for all property types and edge cases
2. Verify change tracking accuracy across complex modifications
3. Test button state management during various form states
4. Verify error message clarity and accessibility
5. Test performance with rapid user input
6. Verify integration with existing CRUD operations

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Task 22-5: Node Management UI and Basic Properties (completed)
- Task 22-6: Node Advanced Properties and Accordion System (completed)

## Files Modified

### Modified Files
- `src/components/tabs/NodePropertiesForm.tsx` (add validation and change tracking)
- `src/components/tabs/NodesTab.tsx` (enhance change detection and button states)
- `src/components/tabs/NodeCreationControls.tsx` (improve button state management)
- `src/types/tabs.ts` (add validation and change tracking types)

### New Files
- `src/utils/nodeValidation.ts` (comprehensive validation utilities)
- `src/utils/changeTracking.ts` (change detection and tracking utilities)
- `src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts` (custom hook for form validation)
- `src/hooks/useChangeTracking.ts` (custom hook for change tracking)

## Notes

This task focuses on creating a production-ready form validation and change tracking system that provides excellent user experience while maintaining performance. The implementation should be extensible to support future property types and validation requirements.

The validation system should be designed with accessibility in mind, providing clear feedback to all users including those using screen readers. Change tracking should be efficient enough to handle real-time updates without performance degradation.
