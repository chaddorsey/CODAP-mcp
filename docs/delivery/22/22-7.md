# [22-7] Node CRUD Operations via MCP Tools

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Integrate node create, read, update, delete operations using MCP tools with comprehensive error handling. This task focuses on implementing robust CRUD operations that use the existing MCP tool infrastructure to perform node management operations with proper error handling, validation, and status feedback.

| 2025-01-27 00:15:00 | Status Update | InProgress | Done | Enhanced CRUD operations with comprehensive error handling and user feedback - Enhanced handleCreateNode with validation and auto-refresh, improved handleUpdateNode with change tracking and validation, enhanced handleDeleteNode with confirmation dialog, improved handleNodeSelect with detailed feedback, added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages, implemented loading states and status indicators, added color-coded status display (success/error/info), integrated proper validation before API calls. All CRUD operations now provide robust error handling and clear user feedback. | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

### Primary Requirements
1. **Create Node Operation**
   - Use `sage_create_node` MCP tool
   - Support all node properties (basic + advanced)
   - Comprehensive validation before API call
   - Proper error handling and user feedback
   - Auto-refresh node list after successful creation

2. **Read Node Operations**
   - Use `sage_get_all_nodes` for listing nodes
   - Use `sage_get_node_by_id` for individual node details
   - Handle empty node lists gracefully
   - Proper error handling for network issues
   - Efficient data transformation for UI consumption

3. **Update Node Operation**
   - Use `sage_update_node` MCP tool
   - Support partial updates with only changed properties
   - Change tracking to optimize API calls
   - Validation before update submission
   - Clear feedback on update success/failure

4. **Delete Node Operation**
   - Use `sage_delete_node` MCP tool
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Proper cleanup of UI state after deletion
   - Error handling for dependency conflicts
   - Auto-refresh node list after successful deletion

5. **Error Handling and Validation**
   - Network error handling with retry options
   - Validation error display with specific field feedback
   - API error message translation to user-friendly text
   - Loading states during API operations
   - Graceful degradation for service unavailability

### Secondary Requirements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Debounced API calls for form changes
   - Efficient state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Caching strategies for node lists
   - Progressive loading for large node sets

2. **User Experience**
   - Loading indicators during operations
   - Success/failure feedback messages
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
   - Accessibility support for screen readers

3. **Integration with Existing Components**
   - Seamless integration with NodePropertiesForm
   - Proper state synchronization with NodeCreationControls
   - Consistent behavior with NodeSelectionList
   - Maintain existing visual design patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced CRUD Function Implementation
1. Implement robust `handleCreateNode` function
2. Enhance `handleNodeSelect` with proper error handling
3. Implement `handleUpdateNode` with change tracking
4. Implement `handleDeleteNode` with confirmation

### Phase 2: Error Handling and Validation
1. Add comprehensive error handling wrapper
2. Implement API error message translation
3. Add loading state management
4. Implement validation before API calls

### Phase 3: User Feedback Systems
1. Add success/failure message display
2. Implement loading indicators
3. Add confirmation dialogs
4. Integrate with existing status system

### Phase 4: Performance and UX Optimization
1. Add debouncing for API calls
2. Implement efficient state management
3. Add keyboard shortcuts
4. Enhance accessibility features

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- CRUD function error handling
- API response parsing and validation
- State management during operations
- Loading state transitions

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end node creation workflow
- Node update operations with form integration
- Node deletion with proper cleanup
- Error recovery scenarios

### UI Tests
- Loading indicators during operations
- Error message display and formatting
- Confirmation dialog behavior
- Accessibility compliance

## Verification

### Success Criteria
1. All CRUD operations work reliably with MCP tools
2. Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
3. Proper loading states and user feedback
4. Efficient API call patterns with change tracking
5. Seamless integration with existing UI components
6. Graceful handling of network and service issues

### Acceptance Tests
1. Create nodes with various property combinations
2. Update existing nodes and verify changes
3. Delete nodes and verify UI cleanup
4. Test error scenarios (network issues, validation failures)
5. Verify loading states and feedback messages
6. Test accessibility with screen readers

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Task 22-5: Node Management UI and Basic Properties (completed)
- Task 22-6: Node Advanced Properties and Accordion System (completed)
- Task 22-4: MCP Tool Execution Framework (for API infrastructure)

### External Dependencies
- MCP tool infrastructure (sage_create_node, sage_update_node, etc.)
- Browser Worker Service for tool execution
- Existing error handling patterns from SageModelerAPIPanel

## Files Modified

### Modified Files
- `src/components/tabs/NodesTab.tsx` (enhance CRUD operations)
- `src/components/tabs/NodeCreationControls.tsx` (improve error handling)
- `src/components/tabs/NodeSelectionList.tsx` (enhance refresh logic)
- `src/services/BrowserWorkerService.ts` (if needed for optimization)

### Potential New Files
- `src/utils/nodeValidation.ts` (comprehensive validation utilities)
- `src/utils/apiErrorHandling.ts` (error handling utilities)

## Notes

This task focuses on making the node management system production-ready by implementing robust CRUD operations with comprehensive error handling. The implementation should maintain the existing user experience while adding reliability and proper feedback mechanisms.

The CRUD operations should be designed to handle real-world scenarios including network issues, validation failures, and service unavailability while providing clear feedback to users about the state of their operations.
