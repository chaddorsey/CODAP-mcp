# [22-4] MCP Tool Execution Framework Enhancement

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Enhance the MCP tool execution framework to support comprehensive API operations with proper logging, error handling, and status management that matches the reference plugin's functionality for all SageModeler API operations.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-01-06 12:20:00 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created for MCP tool execution framework enhancement | AI_Agent |
| 2025-01-06 12:25:00 | Status Update | Proposed | InProgress | Started enhancement of MCP tool execution framework for comprehensive SageModeler API operations | AI_Agent |
| 2025-01-06 13:00:00 | Status Update | InProgress | Done | Complete MCP tool execution framework enhancement - implemented comprehensive error handling with different log message types (request/response/success/error/info), enhanced status management with real-time updates, added timeout protection (30 seconds), improved node/link management with better validation and user feedback, added automatic form population when nodes are selected, enhanced logging with timestamps and structured message formatting, and integrated all improvements seamlessly with the tab system | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

### Primary Requirements
1. **Enhanced Tool Execution System**
   - Improve MCP tool execution to handle all SageModeler API operations
   - Add proper error handling and status reporting
   - Implement comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **API Operation Support**
   - Support for node creation, updating, and deletion
   - Support for link creation, updating, and deletion
   - Support for model import/export operations
   - Support for experiment execution
   - Support for recording controls
   - Support for settings management

3. **Logging and Status Management**
   - Terminal-style log display matching reference plugin
   - Real-time status updates during operations
   - Clear success/error state indication

4. **Request/Response Handling**
   - Proper request formatting for SageModeler API
   - Response parsing and error handling
   - Timeout and retry mechanisms

5. **Integration with Tab System**
   - Connect tool execution with existing tab components
   - Ensure all tab operations can trigger appropriate MCP tools
   - Maintain state consistency across tabs

### Technical Approach
1. Analyze existing MCP tool execution framework
2. Identify gaps for SageModeler API operations
3. Enhance tool execution with comprehensive error handling
4. Implement proper logging and status management
5. Test integration with tab system

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All SageModeler API operations can be executed via MCP tools
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging is implemented
- [ ] Status updates are displayed in real-time
- [ ] Tool execution integrates seamlessly with tab system
- [ ] Request/response handling is robust and reliable
- [ ] Build process continues to work correctly

## Implementation Plan

1. **Framework Analysis**
   - Analyze current MCP tool execution system
   - Identify required enhancements for SageModeler API
   - Map out tool execution flow

2. **Enhancement Implementation**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement logging system integration
   - Enhance status management
   - Add request/response handling improvements

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test with existing tab components
   - Verify all API operations work correctly
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging

## Verification

1. Tool execution works for all planned SageModeler operations
2. Logging displays correctly in the UI
3. Error handling provides clear user feedback
4. Status updates work in real-time
5. Integration with tab system is seamless

## Files Modified

- Potentially `src/components/SageModelerAPIPanel.tsx` - Enhanced tool execution
- Potentially `src/services/BrowserWorkerService.ts` - Enhanced service integration
- Other service/utility files as needed for tool execution enhancement
