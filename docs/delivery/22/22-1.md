# 22-1 Analyze and Prepare Reference Plugin for Integration

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Analyze the existing reference SageModeler plugin (`design/reference/sage-api-plugin.html`) to understand its structure, dependencies, functionality, and integration requirements for iframe embedding. This foundational analysis will inform all subsequent implementation decisions.

#### **JavaScript Functionality Mapping**
1. **Event Handlers**: Document all interactive JavaScript functionality
2. **API Integration**: Map all SageModeler API calls and communication patterns
3. **State Management**: Analyze how the plugin manages internal state
4. **External Dependencies**: Identify any external JavaScript libraries or CDN resources

### **Phase 2: Compatibility Assessment (Day 1-2)**

#### **Iframe Compatibility Check**
1. **Same-Origin Requirements**: Verify compatibility with same-origin serving
2. **Frame Restrictions**: Check for any X-Frame-Options or CSP issues
3. **External Resources**: Assess compatibility of external resource loading in iframe context
4. **JavaScript Sandboxing**: Evaluate how JavaScript functionality will work in iframe

#### **Integration Challenge Identification**
1. **Cross-Origin Issues**: Identify potential CORS or communication challenges
2. **Resource Loading**: Assess external resource loading in iframe context
3. **Performance Impact**: Evaluate loading and runtime performance considerations
4. **Security Implications**: Document security considerations for iframe embedding

### **Phase 3: Asset and Serving Strategy (Day 2)**

#### **File Serving Analysis**
1. **Asset Dependencies**: Document all files needed for functionality
2. **Build Process Integration**: Plan how to include reference plugin in builds
3. **Deployment Strategy**: Design approach for serving across environments
4. **Caching Strategy**: Plan appropriate cache headers and strategies

#### **Migration Path Planning**
1. **Component Mapping**: Identify components suitable for future React conversion
2. **State Management**: Plan future state integration approaches
3. **API Integration**: Document how current API calls could integrate with MCP tools
4. **CSS Migration**: Plan approach for converting to React component styles

## Test Plan

### **Objective**
Verify that the reference plugin analysis is complete, accurate, and provides sufficient information for successful iframe integration implementation.

### **Test Scope**
- Reference plugin functionality analysis
- Integration compatibility assessment
- Asset serving strategy validation
- Documentation completeness verification

### **Key Test Scenarios**

1. **Functionality Verification**:
   - Load reference plugin standalone and test all features
   - Document all interactive elements and their behavior
   - Verify all API endpoints are accessible and functional
   - Test responsive design across different viewport sizes

2. **Integration Simulation**:
   - Test reference plugin loading in a basic iframe context
   - Verify external resource loading works in iframe
   - Test for any JavaScript errors or console warnings
   - Validate that all functionality works within iframe constraints

3. **Asset Dependencies Validation**:
   - Identify and test loading of all required assets
   - Verify no missing dependencies or broken resource links
   - Test resource loading from different serving locations
   - Validate that all assets are transferable to new serving location

4. **Security and Compatibility Testing**:
   - Test iframe embedding with various sandbox settings
   - Verify no frame-busting or anti-iframe code
   - Test cross-origin resource sharing compatibility
   - Validate CSP compatibility for iframe context

### **Success Criteria**
- All reference plugin functionality works in standalone context
- No blocking issues identified for iframe integration
- Asset serving strategy is viable and well-defined
- All external dependencies are compatible with iframe context
- Documentation provides clear path forward for implementation

## Files Modified
- `docs/delivery/22/22-1.md` (this task file)
- `docs/delivery/22/22-1-analysis-report.md` (analysis deliverable - to be created)
- `design/reference/sage-api-plugin.html` (analyzed but not modified)

## Implementation Notes

### **Key Focus Areas**
1. **Iframe Compatibility**: Ensure no technical blockers for iframe embedding
2. **Asset Portability**: Verify all resources can be served from new location
3. **Functionality Preservation**: Confirm all features will work in iframe context
4. **Integration Points**: Identify optimal integration approaches

### **Risk Mitigation Priorities**
1. **External Dependencies**: Plan for any CDN or external resource dependencies
2. **Cross-Origin Issues**: Prepare solutions for potential CORS problems
3. **JavaScript Errors**: Identify any iframe-specific JavaScript issues
4. **CSS Conflicts**: Plan prevention of style conflicts with main plugin

This analysis task provides the foundation for successful iframe integration by ensuring complete understanding of the reference plugin and proactive identification of potential integration challenges.
