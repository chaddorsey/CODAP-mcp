# [22-1] Complete Reference Plugin Audit and Analysis

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Conduct a comprehensive audit of the reference plugin (`design/reference/sage-api-plugin.html`) to document all features, functionality, UI components, data flows, and implementation details. This audit will serve as the definitive blueprint for the migration project, ensuring no functionality is missed and providing detailed specifications for all subsequent tasks.
