# 22-2 Create Iframe Container Component

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Develop a new React component (`SageAPIEmbeddedPanel`) that renders an iframe pointing to `/sage-api-reference.html`, and integrate it as the sole content of the SageModeler accordion-expand section. Remove all previous content from the expandable section. Ensure the iframe is responsive, accessible, and sandboxed for security.
