# [22-2] Core Tab System Architecture and Implementation

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement the 6-tab system (Nodes/Links, Experiment, Recording, Import/Export, Settings, Inspector) with proper state management. This involves creating the foundational tab structure that will house all the migrated functionality from the reference plugin.

| 2025-01-06 11:30:00 | Status Update | InProgress | Done | Complete 6-tab system implemented with TypeScript interfaces, TabSystem component, Accordion components, specialized tab components for Recording/Settings/Inspector, proper state management, and CSS styling. All ESLint errors resolved. Tab switching and accordion functionality working correctly. | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

### Primary Requirements
1. **Tab System Architecture**
   - Implement 6 main tabs: Nodes/Links, Experiment, Recording, Import/Export, Settings, Inspector
   - Add sub-tab system for Nodes/Links (Nodes sub-tab, Links sub-tab)
   - Ensure tab switching works properly with state preservation
   - Implement responsive design for different screen sizes

2. **State Management**
   - Maintain tab state across component re-renders
   - Preserve form data when switching between tabs
   - Handle tab-specific initialization and cleanup
   - Support deep linking to specific tabs

3. **UI Structure**
   - Match reference plugin layout and styling
   - Implement proper tab button states (selected/unselected)
   - Add tab content containers with proper show/hide behavior
   - Support accordion sections within tabs

4. **Integration Points**
   - Ensure compatibility with existing MCP functionality
   - Maintain connection to SageModeler mode detection
   - Support for future content population in each tab

### Technical Requirements
- React component structure for maintainability
- TypeScript interfaces for tab management
- SCSS styling consistent with existing design system
- Unit tests for tab switching logic

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Tab Structure
1. Create TabSystem component with main tab navigation
2. Implement tab state management with React hooks
3. Add basic tab content containers
4. Style tab buttons and content areas

### Phase 2: Sub-Tab System
1. Add sub-tab navigation for Nodes/Links tab
2. Implement sub-tab state management
3. Create proper content containers for sub-tabs
4. Add sub-tab switching logic

### Phase 3: Accordion Support
1. Implement accordion component for collapsible sections
2. Add accordion state management
3. Style accordion headers and content
4. Test accordion functionality within tabs

### Phase 4: State Management
1. Implement tab state persistence
2. Add form data preservation between tabs
3. Handle tab-specific initialization
4. Add error handling for tab operations

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- Tab switching behavior works correctly
- Tab state is preserved during component re-renders
- Sub-tab navigation functions properly
- Accordion expand/collapse works as expected

### Integration Tests
- Tab system integrates with SageModeler panel
- Existing MCP functionality remains intact
- Tab system responsive on different screen sizes
- Performance is acceptable with all tabs present

### Success Criteria
- All 6 tabs render correctly
- Tab switching works smoothly
- Sub-tabs function properly within Nodes/Links
- Accordion sections expand/collapse correctly
- No regression in existing MCP functionality

## Files Modified
- `src/components/SageModelerAPIPanel.tsx` - Main tab system implementation
- `src/components/tabs/` - New directory for tab components
- `src/styles/tabs.scss` - Tab system styling
- `src/types/tabs.ts` - Tab-related TypeScript interfaces

## Verification
- Visual inspection of tab system matches reference plugin
- Functional testing of all tab switching
- Code review for component structure and maintainability
- Performance testing with all tabs loaded
