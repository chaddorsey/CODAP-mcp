# 1-2 Implement session creation endpoint

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description  
Implement `POST /api/sessions` endpoint that creates a new session code and returns `{ code, ttl }` JSON. Originally planned as Edge Function with KV storage, but implemented as Node.js function with demo storage due to production deployment constraints.

## Requirements
* 8-character Base32 code, 40-bit entropy.
* TTL default 10 minutes (configurable).
* Return 201 with JSON `{ code, ttl }`.
* Basic rate-limiting validation.
* CORS support for cross-origin requests.

**Note**: KV persistence was moved to Task 1-6 due to production deployment requirements.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add route configuration for `/api/sessions`.
2. Implement handler in `api/sessions.js` using Node.js runtime.
3. Implement session code generation with Base32 encoding.
4. Add CORS support and basic validation.
5. Return demo response indicating need for KV implementation.

## Verification
* Manual testing returns valid 8-character Base32 codes.
* CORS headers properly configured.
* Production deployment accessible with SSO bypass.
* Integration tests pass.

## Files Modified
* `api/sessions.js` (new) ✅
* `vercel.json` (updated) ✅
* `test-local-api.js` (updated for testing) ✅

## Implementation Notes
* **Runtime Change**: Switched from Edge Functions to Node.js runtime due to TypeScript compilation issues in Edge environment.
* **KV Storage Deferred**: Persistent storage implementation moved to Task 1-6 to focus on production deployment.
* **Demo Mode**: Current implementation includes demo messages indicating KV storage is needed.
