# 1-4 Implement request/response endpoints & KV

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Implement LLM-facing `POST /request` and browser-facing `POST /response` endpoints. Originally planned as Edge Functions with KV storage, but implemented as Node.js functions with demo storage due to production deployment constraints.

## Requirements
* `POST /request` body validation and processing.
* `POST /response` body validation and processing.
* Basic rate-limiting validation.
* CORS support for cross-origin requests.
* Return 202 Accepted on successful processing.

**Note**: KV storage and actual message queuing moved to Task 1-6 due to production deployment requirements.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add routes to `vercel.json`.
2. Implement `server/relay/post-request.ts` and `post-response.ts`.
3. Share validation schemas in `server/relay/schemas.ts`.
4. Unit tests for validation and KV enqueue.

## Verification
* Jest tests cover happy path & invalid body 400.
* End-to-end test (Task 1-5) passes.

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented both POST endpoints with the following features:

**POST /request endpoint:**
- Validates tool requests with basic schema validation
- Session code validation
- Basic rate limiting validation
- Returns 202 Accepted with demo message
- Logs requests for debugging (no persistent storage)

**POST /response endpoint:**
- Validates tool responses with basic schema validation
- Session code validation
- Basic rate limiting validation
- Returns 202 Accepted with demo message
- Logs responses for debugging (no persistent storage)

**Common features:**
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Comprehensive error handling with structured responses
- Node.js runtime for production compatibility
- Demo messages indicating KV storage is needed

## Files Modified
* `api/request.js` (created) - LLM-facing tool request endpoint
* `api/response.js` (created) - Browser-facing tool response endpoint  
* `vercel.json` (updated) - Added /request and /response routes
* `test-local-api.js` (updated) - Integration tests for API endpoints

## Implementation Notes
* **Runtime Change**: Switched from Edge Functions to Node.js runtime due to TypeScript compilation issues.
* **KV Storage Deferred**: Persistent storage and actual message queuing moved to Task 1-6.
* **Demo Mode**: Current implementation includes demo messages indicating KV storage is needed.
